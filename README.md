# HW0 Programming Assignment – Intro to R

This repository contains my submission for Homework 0 of an introductory R programming course. The assignment demonstrates basic R programming skills including:

- Creating vectors and strings
- Reading data from CSV files
- Writing simple functions
- Performing matrix operations
- Generating plots (histograms)

## Files Included

- `HW0_Assignment.Rmd` – RMarkdown file containing all assignment code and comments
- `SampleData.csv` – Sample data used for function testing
- `BikeRentals.csv` – Dataset used to generate histogram of hourly bike rentals
- `HW0_Assignment.pdf` – Compiled PDF output from the RMarkdown file

## How to Run

To run this assignment and generate the PDF:

1. Open RStudio or any RMarkdown-compatible editor.
2. Load the required CSV files (`SampleData.csv`, `BikeRentals.csv`) into your working directory.
3. Open `HW0_Assignment.Rmd`.
4. Click **Knit** to compile the document into a PDF.

## Example Plot

The assignment includes a histogram showing the distribution of bike rentals per hour:
